This routine draws circles of specified radii that are divided into
a definable number of alternating black and white segments. These discs
can used to measure the speed of rotation of motors etc. When viewed
under a light that is powered by mains electricity the patterns will
appear stationary at certain rotation speeds. In Europe these speeds
are given by 6000/N rpm - where N is the number of black segments.
In the US and other areas that use a 60Hz mains frequency the formula
becomes: 7200/N rpm.
