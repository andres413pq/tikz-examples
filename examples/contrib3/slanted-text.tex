   % In italicized environments normal small caps often looks wrong because of
   % its upright shape. A solution is to simply use all-uppercase in these
   % environments, but this too is ugly. Using TikZ one can fake a slant. This
   % is not that great, but better than nothing.

   % Note that http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/kpfonts/ for example
   % provides a font which has slanted small caps by default.
