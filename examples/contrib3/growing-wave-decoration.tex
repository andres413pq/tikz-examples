% A decoration of a path which evolves with time.
% Settings is there such that you can change the
% start amplitude, end amplitude and the wave length.
% Furthermore you decide whether it should start as a cosine or sine wave.
%
% Of course the start size and end size can be switched which gives a decreasing wave.

:Title: Growing wave decoration

A path decoration that evolves with time. Options are available for setting
start amplitude, end amplitude and the wave length. Furthermore you an set whether it should 
start as a cosine or sine wave. The start size and end size can be switched which gives a decreasing wave.
